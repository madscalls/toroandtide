# Toro & Tide,

###### (Sushi side project)

#### Hello! This is my first independant project where I could really showcase all that I've learned so far.

### I got the chance to excercise my creativity and my css knowledge. I learned some cool new tricks along the way, and built a lot of self confidence by executing my idea. I hope you enjoy this cute webpage for a quirky, polished new sushi spot, Toro & Tide. :)

### This was my first dabble in javascript on my own and also creating functioning links to seperate pages.

### The spinning sushis were my favorite part to execute. I really hope you enjoy!

###### I opted out of making media queries so I don't spend too much time away from studying.
